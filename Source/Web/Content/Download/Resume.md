## Objective
To apply and grow my existing skill-set in a challenging, fast-paced, and rewarding software engineering environment.
To bring a new level of efficiency and stability to software projects by utilizing the latest technologies and software engineering ideals.

## Summary
### I Love Technology (and Learning)
Almost everything I do has something to do with technology and learning. Not only do I write software every day, but I always have one or more side projects in progress. In my free time, my goal isn't always to "ship" a product or to reach a defined goal — often I simply want to learn something. Whether I'm working on a JavaScript framework, catching a glimpse of Jupiter through my telescope, installing a PC in my car, donating my tech skills for a cause in which I believe, building an HTML game engine, configuring a Linux mail server, designing and budgeting my next house project, or printing something in 3D — view my profile on Thingiverse (http://www.thingiverse.com/QuantumConcepts) — it all comes back to technology and my unquenchable thirst for knowledge. I live and breathe this stuff.

### What Drives Me
I'm driven by being challenged. I enjoy facing, dissecting, and solving problems. I also like to help people solve their own problems — view my profile on Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/users/374198/josh-m?tab=answers) for examples. I am motivated by knowing that someone is going to use and enjoy what I am working on. I strive to create concise solutions to the programming problems I face. I believe code is almost an art. A lot of people can write something which works, but not everyone can do that correctly. I pride myself on writing clean, concise, reusable and scalable code.

## Projects
Please find below a small collection of my work. I've highlighted my involvement on each project.

### ARMATURE Fabric
