      <Heading Level="3">I Love Technology (and Learning)</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        Almost everything I do has something to do with technology and learning. Not only do I write software <Text Class="em">every day</Text>, but I always have one or more side projects in progress. In my free time, my goal isn't always to "ship" a product or to reach a defined goal &#8212; often I simply want to <Text Class="em">learn something</Text>. Whether I'm working on a JavaScript framework, catching a glimpse of Jupiter through my telescope, installing a PC in my car, donating my tech skills for a cause in which I believe, building an HTML5 game engine, configuring a Linux mail server, designing and budgeting my next house project, or printing something in 3D &#8212; <Link Url="http://www.thingiverse.com/QuantumConcepts">view my profile on Thingiverse</Link> &#8212; it all comes back to technology and my unquenchable thirst for knowledge.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>I live and breathe this stuff.</Paragraph>

      <Heading Level="3">What Drives Me</Heading>
      <Paragraph>
        I'm driven by being challenged. I enjoy facing, dissecting, and solving problems. I also like to help people solve their own problems &#8212; <Link Url="http://stackoverflow.com/users/374198/josh-m?tab=answers">view my profile on Stack Overflow</Link> for examples. I am motivated by knowing that <Text Class="em">someone</Text> is going to use and enjoy what I am working on. I strive to create concise solutions to the programming problems I face. I believe code is almost an art. A lot of people can write something which <Text Class="em">works</Text>, but not everyone can do that <Text Class="em">correctly</Text>. I pride myself on writing clean, concise, reusable and scalable code.
